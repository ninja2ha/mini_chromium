// IOBuffers are reference counted data buffers used for easier asynchronous
// IO handling.
//
// They are often used as the destination buffers for Read() operations, or as
// the source buffers for Write() operations.
//
// IMPORTANT: Never re-use an IOBuffer after cancelling the IO operation that
//            was using it, since this may lead to memory corruption!
//
// -----------------------
// Ownership of IOBuffers:
// -----------------------
//
// Although IOBuffers are RefCountedThreadSafe, they are not intended to be
// used as a shared buffer, nor should they be used simultaneously across
// threads. The fact that they are reference counted is an implementation
// detail for allowing them to outlive cancellation of asynchronous
// operations.
//
// Instead, think of the underlying |char*| buffer contained by the IOBuffer
// as having exactly one owner at a time.
//
// Whenever you call an asynchronous operation that takes an IOBuffer,
// ownership is implicitly transferred to the called function, until the
// operation has completed (at which point it transfers back to the caller).
//
//     ==> The IOBuffer's data should NOT be manipulated, destroyed, or read
//         until the operation has completed.
//
//     ==> Cancellation does NOT count as completion. If an operation using
//         an IOBuffer is cancelled, the caller should release their
//         reference to this IOBuffer at the time of cancellation since
//         they can no longer use it.
//
// For instance, if you were to call a Read() operation on some class which
// takes an IOBuffer, and then delete that class (which generally will
// trigger cancellation), the IOBuffer which had been passed to Read() should
// never be re-used.
//
// This usage contract is assumed by any API which takes an IOBuffer, even
// though it may not be explicitly mentioned in the function's comments.
//
// -----------------------
// Motivation
// -----------------------
//
// The motivation for transferring ownership during cancellation is
// to make it easier to work with un-cancellable operations.
//
// For instance, let's say under the hood your API called out to the
// operating system's synchronous ReadFile() function on a worker thread.
// When cancelling through our asynchronous interface, we have no way of
// actually aborting the in progress ReadFile(). We must let it keep running,
// and hence the buffer it was reading into must remain alive. Using
// reference counting we can add a reference to the IOBuffer and make sure
// it is not destroyed until after the synchronous operation has completed.
